# Breaking Waves: Flight to Safety During the COVID-19 Pandemic

March 12, 2020, witnessed Wall Street's most terrifying day since the 2008 financial crisis. The Dow Jones Index plummeted 2,352 points, falling nearly 10%. The Nasdaq dropped over 9%. Oil prices crashed 24%. Gold, the traditional safe-haven asset, declined 3%.

But the most shocking performance came from Bitcoin. This digital currency, dubbed "digital gold" and viewed as the new era's safe-haven asset, plummeted from $8,000 to $3,800 in a single day—a drop exceeding 50%.

In a trading room in Manhattan, New York, MicroStrategy's CFO Phong Le stared at the blood-red numbers on his screen, his emotions conflicted. Months earlier, CEO Michael Saylor had been touting Bitcoin's safe-haven value in internal meetings, but now they faced such harsh reality.

"Maybe we were all wrong," Le whispered to his colleague sitting nearby, "Maybe Bitcoin isn't a safe-haven asset at all."

But history would soon prove this judgment premature. This financial tsunami, called "Black Thursday," would ultimately become the starting point for Bitcoin's true emergence as an institutional-grade asset.

## Awakening in the Liquidity Crisis

The March 2020 crash left many Bitcoin investors shocked and confused. They had originally expected Bitcoin to function like gold during financial turbulence as a safe haven, but reality proved starkly different.

This phenomenon has a professional term in finance: correlation spike. Under extreme market stress, all assets' correlations approach 1, as investors indiscriminately sell various assets to obtain cash liquidity.

"In liquidity crises, only cash is king," said Jack Thompson, a veteran Wall Street trader, in an interview. "Whether stocks, bonds, gold, or Bitcoin, everything gets sold for cash."

But this phenomenon also revealed an important fact: Bitcoin had become mainstream enough to be held by institutional investors, which is why it faced such massive selling pressure during the liquidity crisis. If Bitcoin were still just a niche asset in geek circles, it wouldn't have experienced such significant selling pressure.

More importantly, the Bitcoin network itself demonstrated remarkable resilience during this crisis. Even as prices crashed, the Bitcoin network continued operating normally, with stable transaction confirmation times and unaffected security. This stood in stark contrast to many traditional financial institutions' performance during the 2008 financial crisis.

## Unprecedented Monetary Easing Policies

If March 12th's crash made people question Bitcoin's safe-haven properties, the following months' central bank policy responses provided Bitcoin with the strongest fundamental support.

On March 15, the Federal Reserve announced it would cut interest rates to zero and launch a $700 billion quantitative easing program. But this was just the beginning. Over the following months, the Fed's balance sheet rapidly expanded from $4 trillion to nearly $9 trillion, with money supply growth reaching historic records.

The European Central Bank wasn't far behind. They launched the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) totaling €1.35 trillion and extended asset purchase programs until 2022.

The Bank of Japan further loosened its already years-long ultra-loose monetary policy, promising "unlimited" government bond purchases to stabilize markets.

China, though relatively restrained, also injected massive liquidity into markets through reserve requirement ratio cuts and interest rate reductions.

This global monetary flood was unprecedented in history. In just a few months, major economies' central banks injected more liquidity than the total of the previous decade.

## Reigniting Inflation Expectations

The massive monetary easing policies quickly produced expected side effects: inflation expectations began rising.

The clearest signals came from commodity markets. Gold prices rebounded from March lows, breaking the historic high of $2,000/ounce by August. Oil prices, despite experiencing the historic event of negative pricing, also quickly rebounded from lows. Agricultural product prices also began rising.

More importantly, long-term inflation expectations started rising. The U.S. 10-year breakeven inflation rate (TIPS) quickly rebounded from negative values in March to over 2% by year-end.

In this context, investors began reassessing Bitcoin's value proposition. If March's crash made people question Bitcoin's safe-haven properties, subsequent inflation expectations reawakened interest in the "digital gold" narrative.

Bitcoin's fixed supply characteristic appeared especially attractive in this environment. Unlike fiat currencies that can be printed infinitely, Bitcoin's total supply will never exceed 21 million coins. This scarcity has special value in an era of monetary flood.

## Paul Tudor Jones's Historic Declaration

In May 2020, a heavyweight figure's statement completely changed institutional investors' view of Bitcoin. Paul Tudor Jones, the legendary macro investor managing $22 billion in assets, publicly expressed support for Bitcoin in a letter to investors.

"We are in an era of monetary inflation," Jones wrote in the letter, "In this environment, it makes sense to own some 'millennial gold' (referring to Bitcoin)."

The impact of this letter cannot be overstated. Paul Tudor Jones was not only one of Wall Street's most respected investors but also a top expert in macro investing. His successful short before the 1987 stock market crash and precise judgments during currency crises earned him enormous prestige in the investment world.

Jones's support brought two important impacts to Bitcoin. First, it provided other institutional investors with an investment logic framework they could follow. Second, it eliminated the "reputational risk" many investors harbored—if even Paul Tudor Jones held Bitcoin, other investors could openly discuss and invest in this asset.

"Paul's statement was a turning point," said an anonymous hedge fund manager. "It transformed Bitcoin investment from 'potentially ridiculed behavior' to 'risk of missing opportunities.'"

## MicroStrategy's All-In Experiment

If Paul Tudor Jones's statement provided theoretical foundation for Bitcoin investment, MicroStrategy's actions provided a practical template.

On August 11, 2020, this business intelligence software company announced a decision that shocked Wall Street: using $250 million in cash reserves to purchase Bitcoin as the company's primary reserve asset. This wasn't tentative small-scale investment but strategic major betting.

Behind this decision was CEO Michael Saylor's profound thinking. Saylor believed that in the current monetary environment, holding cash actually meant bearing "melting ice cube" risk. Inflation would slowly but persistently erode cash value, while Bitcoin provided a better store of value option.

"Our cash is losing purchasing power every year," Saylor explained in the company's earnings call, "We need a reserve asset that can maintain or even increase value. Bitcoin is the best choice we found."

MicroStrategy's purchases didn't stop at the first time. Over the following months, the company continued buying Bitcoin through convertible bond issuances and other means. By the end of 2020, MicroStrategy held over 70,000 bitcoins, becoming the publicly traded company with the most Bitcoin holdings.

This practice was unprecedented in financial management. Traditionally, companies' cash reserves should be invested in safe, highly liquid assets like short-term government bonds or bank deposits. Investing large amounts of cash in highly volatile digital assets seemed inconceivable to many CFOs.

But Saylor's logic was clear: in an era of monetary flood, traditional "safe" assets aren't actually safe. Cash and bonds both face inflation risk, while Bitcoin, though highly volatile, is a better long-term store of value tool.

## Square's Pleasant Surprise

Just months after MicroStrategy announced its Bitcoin purchase, another well-known company joined the ranks. On October 8, payment company Square announced using $50 million to purchase Bitcoin, representing about 1% of its total cash assets.

Square's purchase reasoning differed from MicroStrategy's. As a payment company, Square focused more on Bitcoin's potential as the foundation of a "more inclusive global financial system." But in investment decisions, they similarly viewed Bitcoin as a superior reserve asset to cash.

"We believe Bitcoin has the potential to become a global currency," Square wrote in its announcement, "As it becomes increasingly adopted, we want to learn and participate in this evolving ecosystem."

Though Square's purchase amount wasn't as massive as MicroStrategy's, its symbolic significance was equally important. It showed that the concept of Bitcoin as corporate reserve asset was gaining broader acceptance.

## Tesla's $1.5B Historic Purchase

On February 8, 2021, Tesla's 10-K filing to the SEC revealed shocking news: the company had purchased $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin and planned to accept Bitcoin as payment for products in the future.

This news was like throwing a boulder into a calm lake, creating huge ripples. Tesla was not only the world's highest market-cap automaker, but its CEO Elon Musk was also a highly influential public figure. Tesla's purchase decision immediately pushed Bitcoin prices above $40,000.

Musk's support for Bitcoin wasn't limited to purchasing. He changed his Twitter bio to "#bitcoin" and frequently endorsed Bitcoin on social media. His tweet "In retrospect, it was inevitable" became a classic phrase in the Bitcoin community.

Tesla's purchase decision also faced some controversy, particularly regarding Bitcoin mining's environmental impact. But these controversies actually proved that Bitcoin had become an unavoidable topic.

## Insurance Companies' Historic Allocation

In December 2020, a more conservative institutional investor joined the Bitcoin investment ranks: Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company (MassMutual) announced purchasing $100 million in Bitcoin.

Insurance companies' fund allocation is typically extremely conservative, mainly investing in government bonds and high-grade corporate bonds. MassMutual's Bitcoin investment, though only 0.04% of its total assets, carried enormous symbolic significance.

"If even insurance companies are starting to allocate to Bitcoin, this shows Bitcoin has truly entered mainstream investment vision," commented Barry Silbert, CEO of Grayscale.

MassMutual's investment decision was based on judgment about the long-term investment environment. In low interest rate environments, traditional fixed-income investments face yield pressure. Though Bitcoin carries higher risk, if successful, it would provide significant portfolio enhancement.

## Avalanche-Style Institutional Entry

In the second half of 2020 and early 2021, institutional funds began pouring into Bitcoin markets like an avalanche. Besides the companies mentioned earlier, many other institutional investors began allocating to Bitcoin.

Ruffer Investment Management, a British asset management company managing $27 billion, allocated 2.5% of its assets to Bitcoin. Their reasoning was "hedging currency devaluation risk."

One River Asset Management launched a dedicated Bitcoin fund and planned to increase Bitcoin and Ethereum holdings to $1 billion in 2021.

Mode Global Holdings, a London-based investment company, announced converting all excess cash to Bitcoin.

SkyBridge Capital, the hedge fund founded by Anthony Scaramucci, launched a Bitcoin fund and vigorously promoted digital asset investment.

This avalanche effect of institutional entry produced significant market impact. Unlike 2017's mainly retail-driven bull market, the 2020-2021 price surge was primarily driven by institutional demand. This demand was more stable and sustainable.

## Fundamental Change in Supply and Demand Structure

Institutional investors' entry fundamentally changed Bitcoin's supply and demand structure. Unlike retail investors, institutional investors typically adopt long-term holding strategies, reducing circulating supply in the market.

More importantly, institutional investors' purchase volumes are often large. MicroStrategy alone held over 100,000 bitcoins, equivalent to 0.5% of total supply. If 100 similar-scale companies adopted the same strategy, they could control 50% of Bitcoin supply.

This supply scarcity further pushed up Bitcoin prices. From March 2020 lows to early 2021, Bitcoin prices rose over 10-fold, setting historic highs.

ARK Invest analysts believed this institutionalization trend was just beginning. They predicted that if S&P 500 companies allocated 1% of their cash reserves to Bitcoin, it could drive Bitcoin prices up about $40,000.

## Federal Reserve's Unexpected Assist

2020's monetary policy not only supported Bitcoin through inflation expectations but also generated positive impact through another channel: confidence shock to the traditional financial system.

When the Federal Reserve began directly purchasing corporate bonds and even considered buying stock ETFs, some investors began questioning the traditional financial system's sustainability. They worried that central banks' excessive intervention might distort market mechanisms and create moral hazard.

In this context, Bitcoin as an asset uncontrolled by governments and immune to arbitrary manipulation appeared particularly attractive. It provided an "exit option," allowing investors to partially escape the traditional financial system.

"Bitcoin is not only a hedge against inflation but also a hedge against excessive centralization of the financial system," wrote renowned investor Lyn Alden in her research report.

This viewpoint gained more investor recognition during the pandemic. Traditional financial safety nets were becoming increasingly dependent on government and central bank support, while Bitcoin provided an alternative based on mathematics and code rather than political decisions.

## Final Establishment of the Narrative

By early 2021, the "digital gold" narrative had been basically established among institutional investors. Though Bitcoin still had high volatility, more and more investors believed it had long-term store of value function.

This narrative establishment wasn't instantaneous but evolved over many years. From the initial "digital cash" to "speculative asset" to "digital gold," Bitcoin's positioning gradually clarified.

The pandemic's macro environment provided the best verification opportunity for this narrative. In the context of monetary flood, rising inflation expectations, and declining traditional safe-haven asset yields, Bitcoin's unique properties appeared especially valuable.

Modern portfolio theory also provided academic support for this narrative. Famous economist and Nobel laureate Harry Markowitz once said investors should hold asset portfolios that maximize risk-adjusted returns. Even if Bitcoin is high-risk, if its correlation with other assets is very low, it can still improve portfolio overall performance.

## Wall Street's Final Turn

The 2020-2021 institutionalization wave represented Wall Street's final transformation regarding Bitcoin. From initial skepticism and resistance, to cautious research and testing, to final embrace and allocation, this transformation process lasted over a decade.

This transformation wasn't only reflected in investment decisions but also in public statements. Many Wall Street giants who once criticized Bitcoin began changing their stance.

JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon, though still cautious about Bitcoin, acknowledged that "clients have demand for digital assets, and we need to provide corresponding services."

Goldman Sachs restarted its suspended Bitcoin trading business and began providing Bitcoin investment services for institutional clients.

Bank of America published detailed Bitcoin research reports, calling it "an important component of the digital asset ecosystem."

Citibank analysts published reports saying Bitcoin could become "the currency of international trade."

These transformations reflected a deeper trend: Bitcoin had evolved from a fringe asset to a mainstream investment choice that must be taken seriously. Regardless of personal views, no serious financial institution could completely ignore Bitcoin's existence.

## Historic Significance of Pandemic Catalysis

Looking back, COVID-19's catalytic role in Bitcoin development was enormous. Without the pandemic-induced monetary flood, Bitcoin's institutionalization process might have taken much longer.

The pandemic created a perfect macro environment: low interest rates, high liquidity, inflation expectations, concerns about the traditional financial system. In this environment, all of Bitcoin's value propositions were strengthened.

More importantly, the pandemic accelerated digitization processes. Remote work, digital payments, and digital transformation became mainstream trends. In this context, digital assets seemed more reasonable and necessary.

The pandemic also changed people's risk perception. March 2020's "Black Thursday" made people realize that even the "safest" assets could face liquidity crises. This cognitive change made investors more open to considering alternative assets, including Bitcoin.

In that virus-ravaged, market-turbulent spring, no one could predict that Bitcoin would become the best-performing asset class in the following year. But history's course is often unexpected.

As Warren Buffett once said: "Only when the tide goes out do you discover who's been swimming naked." The 2020 crisis made all assets "swim naked" once, and Bitcoin ultimately proved it could not only swim but swim very well.

When Michael Saylor announced in MicroStrategy's quarterly earnings call that the company would continue buying Bitcoin, his tone was full of confidence. CFO Phong Le, who had been full of doubt months earlier, had now become a firm supporter of this strategy.

"We're not speculating," Saylor told investors, "We're preserving value for shareholders. In a world where currency is constantly diluted, owning scarce assets is the only rational choice."

Outside the window, New York had emerged from the pandemic's gloom, but the marks left by this crisis would forever change the financial world's landscape. Bitcoin, this digital asset born from the last financial crisis, found its historic mission in the new crisis.

History will remember 2020, not only because this was the year the pandemic changed the world, but because this was the year Bitcoin was truly accepted by the mainstream. Those who quietly built infrastructure during bear markets, those who maintained faith amid skepticism, all received history's rewards this year.

But this was just the beginning. Greater changes lay ahead.
