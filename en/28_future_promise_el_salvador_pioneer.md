June 5, 2021, the atmosphere at the Bitcoin conference in Miami Beach was electric. Bitcoin supporters from around the world gathered here to discuss the future of digital assets. But no one anticipated that an upcoming video link would rewrite history.

When El Salvador President Nayib Bukele appeared on the big screen, the thousands of people below fell silent. This 39-year-old millennial president smiled, but his next words would shock the entire world:

"I will submit a bill to Congress to make Bitcoin legal tender in El Salvador."

The venue instantly erupted. This wasn't investment advice or a business experiment, but the first time in human history that a sovereign nation declared it would make Bitcoin legal tender. In that moment, Bitcoin transformed from a financial experiment into geopolitical reality.

Three days later, the El Salvador Congress passed the Bitcoin bill with an overwhelming majority of 62 votes in favor and 19 against. On September 7, 2021, Bitcoin officially became legal tender in El Salvador, enjoying equal status with the U.S. dollar.

This Central American nation's bold experiment opened a new chapter in monetary history.

## Millennial President's Digital Vision

Nayib Armando Bukele Ortez, born in 1981 in San Salvador, is El Salvador's youngest president in history. Unlike traditional politicians, Bukele is a true digital native—he has over 3 million followers on Twitter and frequently communicates directly with citizens through social media, earning the nickname "Twitter President."

Bukele's upbringing shaped his unique worldview. His father was of Palestinian immigrant descent, his mother from a Catholic family—this multicultural background made him question traditional authority structures from an early age. While studying law in university, he showed strong interest in innovation and technology.

In 2015, 34-year-old Bukele was elected mayor of San Salvador. His governing style immediately attracted widespread attention: using social media for government transparency, employing technology to improve city management, and promoting digital transformation. He built modern libraries and parks in the city center and renovated the entire city with LED lighting—these initiatives earned him enormous reputation among young people.

In 2019, Bukele won the presidency with overwhelming support. His campaign slogan "No more corruption" struck a chord, representing the rise of a new generation of Latin American politicians. But what truly brought him international attention was his firm support for Bitcoin.

"I believe technology can change a country," Bukele said in his inaugural speech, "We shouldn't fear innovation, but embrace the future."

## Lightning Passage of the Bitcoin Bill

On June 9, 2021, El Salvador's Congress voted on the Bitcoin bill. This legislation, though only 16 articles long, was profound in significance:

Article 1 established Bitcoin as legal tender, enjoying equal status with the U.S. dollar; Article 7 required all economic entities to accept Bitcoin as payment; Article 12 mandated the government would promote necessary training and mechanisms for citizens to use Bitcoin for transactions.

The bill's passage was surprisingly smooth. Among 84 Congress members, 62 voted in favor with only 19 opposed. This overwhelming support reflected Bukele's enormous influence in El Salvador's political scene.

But this support wasn't without controversy. Opposition legislators questioned Bitcoin's volatility and technical complexity, worrying about harm to ordinary citizens. "Most Salvadorans don't even have bank accounts, how can we expect them to use digital currency?" asked an opposition leader.

Supporters believed this was El Salvador's opportunity to modernize. "We have a chance to become world pioneers," said a legislator supporting the bill, "Why should we fear trying?"

International reactions were more complex. The World Bank stated it "cannot assist El Salvador in implementing Bitcoin," while the International Monetary Fund expressed "concern." But the Bitcoin community celebrated, viewing this as a milestone moment in digital currency history.

## Chivo Wallet's National Experiment

To implement the Bitcoin legal tender policy, El Salvador's government developed a digital wallet app called "Chivo." "Chivo" means "cool" in Salvadoran slang, reflecting the government's desire to make Bitcoin "cool" and user-friendly.

Chivo wallet's launch was essentially a national digital currency education experiment. The government set up over 200 Chivo ATMs nationwide, allowing citizens to conveniently exchange Bitcoin for cash. To encourage usage, the government also gave each wallet user $30 in Bitcoin.

But this experiment's beginning wasn't smooth. On September 7, when the Bitcoin law officially took effect, Chivo wallet servers crashed due to overload, leaving thousands of users unable to function normally. Technical problems, complex user interfaces, and unstable network connections caused many ordinary citizens to distrust digital currency.

"I tried for half a day but couldn't successfully transfer money," complained a vendor in San Salvador, "This thing is too complicated."

But the government quickly responded to these issues. Technical teams worked day and night to fix bugs, customer service personnel provided training everywhere, and the government even broadcast educational programs on TV showing how to use Chivo wallet.

Gradually, conditions improved. Young people first accepted this new tool, then brought along family and friends. By the end of 2021, over 4 million Salvadorans (about 60% of the population) had downloaded Chivo wallet, with about 30% remaining active users.

## Reality Testing of the Remittance Revolution

One of the most important reasons El Salvador adopted Bitcoin was improving international remittances. As a major labor-exporting country, El Salvador has about 2 million nationals working overseas, sending over $6 billion annually—about 20% of GDP.

Traditional remittance channels like Western Union charge fees up to 10% with arrival times of several days. Bitcoin could theoretically reduce fees to a few cents and transfer times to minutes.

This theory was partially verified in practice. A construction worker named José in Los Angeles sent $200 home—using traditional channels required $20 in fees, while through Bitcoin it cost less than $1. "The money saved could buy a week's food for the children," said José's wife.

But technical implementation was more complex than theory. Many overseas Salvadorans were unfamiliar with Bitcoin, requiring additional education and training. Network infrastructure limitations also affected user experience. Rural areas' insufficient network coverage prevented some families from normally receiving remittances.

Nevertheless, data showed this experiment was effective. El Salvador's central bank statistics showed digital remittances' proportion rose from 5% at the beginning of 2021 to 25% by year-end. Though not all digital remittances used Bitcoin, Bitcoin did drive digital transformation of the entire remittance system.

## Bitcoin Bonds' Financial Innovation

In November 2021, Bukele announced an even bolder plan: issuing the world's first sovereign Bitcoin bond. This $1 billion bond would fund Bitcoin purchases and build Bitcoin mining infrastructure.

The plan's core was the "Bitcoin City" concept. The government planned to build a completely Bitcoin-based new city in La Unión Province, using nearby volcanic geothermal energy for Bitcoin mining. This city would levy no taxes except VAT, use entirely renewable energy, and become a pilgrimage site for global Bitcoin enthusiasts.

"This isn't science fiction, this is the reality we're building," Bukele said at the Bitcoin City launch, with the magnificent volcano as backdrop.

International investors reacted variously to this plan. Some Bitcoin supporters considered it historically significant innovation, while traditional investors worried about feasibility and risks. Rating agencies like Standard & Poor's expressed concern about El Salvador's credit rating.

Bitcoin bond issuance also proved more complex than expected. International capital markets lacked assessment standards for this new bond type, and regulators questioned its legal status. By 2022, this bond still hadn't been formally issued, but the government continued preparing related work.

## Complex International Reactions

El Salvador's Bitcoin experiment sparked intense international debate. Supporters viewed it as a monetary innovation milestone, while opponents worried about risks and negative impacts.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) reacted most strongly. They worried Bitcoin's price volatility would affect El Salvador's financial stability and recommended the government reconsider this decision. In January 2022, the IMF explicitly demanded El Salvador remove Bitcoin's legal tender status as a loan condition.

"We're concerned that using Bitcoin as legal tender would bring macroeconomic, financial, and legal risks," said an IMF spokesperson.

The U.S. government's attitude was relatively moderate but still reserved. The Treasury stated understanding of El Salvador's innovation efforts but emphasized ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing requirements. Some Congressional members proposed stricter sanction threats.

The EU and other international organizations mostly adopted wait-and-see attitudes, neither explicitly supporting nor strongly opposing, but awaiting experimental results.

In contrast, some Latin American countries showed strong interest. Politicians in Panama, Paraguay, and Argentina all proposed similar bills, though none ultimately passed, indicating El Salvador's experiment produced demonstration effects.

## Government Bond Purchase Strategy and Fiscal Innovation

Besides using Bitcoin as a payment method, El Salvador's government also used it as a reserve asset. Starting in September 2021, the government began using fiscal funds to purchase Bitcoin and made these purchases public.

Bukele frequently announced government Bitcoin purchases on Twitter, each time attracting international media attention. "Bought another 150 bitcoins," "Taking advantage of price drops to buy more"—these tweets became informal announcements of El Salvador's fiscal policy.

By the end of 2022, El Salvador's government held approximately 2,300 bitcoins with an average purchase price around $45,000. These bitcoins' value fluctuated significantly with market prices, bringing notable impact to government finances.

This strategy sparked domestic controversy. Supporters viewed it as far-sighted investment that would bring long-term benefits to the country. "Our descendants will thank us for today's decision," said a government official.

Opponents worried this was gambling with national finances. "The government should use our taxes to build hospitals and schools, not buy speculative assets," criticized an opposition legislator.

Economists were also divided. Some considered it reasonable diversification investment, while others believed it violated prudent fiscal management principles.

## Reality Check One Year Later

September 7, 2022, marked the first anniversary of Bitcoin law implementation. This year of practice provided preliminary answers for El Salvador's Bitcoin experiment.

From a technical perspective, the experiment achieved partial success. Chivo wallet's technical problems were basically resolved, with significantly improved user experience. Lightning Network deployment in El Salvador was also relatively successful, proving Bitcoin payment network feasibility.

From an economic perspective, results were mixed. Bitcoin did reduce international remittance costs and improve financial inclusion. Data showed more previously unbanked citizens began using digital payment services. But Bitcoin's significant price volatility also caused losses for some users.

From a social perspective, the Bitcoin experiment produced polarizing effects. Young people and urban residents generally accepted it more easily, while elderly and rural residents still mainly relied on cash and dollars.

From a political perspective, this experiment enhanced Bukele's international profile but also brought international pressure. IMF loan negotiations became more complex, with U.S. sanction threats remaining.

From a macroeconomic perspective, Bitcoin policy's overall impact on El Salvador's economy remained unclear. Indicators like economic growth, inflation, and employment showed no significant changes due to Bitcoin policy.

## Volcano Bonds and Geothermal Mining

In 2022, El Salvador took another bold step in Bitcoin innovation: using volcanic geothermal energy for Bitcoin mining. This project carried not only economic significance but also symbolic meaning—using Earth's most primitive energy to mine the most modern digital assets.

El Salvador possesses abundant geothermal resources, with over 20 volcanoes nationwide. The government partnered with private companies to build geothermal Bitcoin mining facilities near Tecapa volcano in La Unión Province. This project used 100% renewable energy, responding to international concerns about Bitcoin mining's environmental impact.

"We're using volcanic power to mine digital gold," Bukele said while inspecting mining facilities, "This is El Salvador's unique advantage."

The geothermal mining project's economic benefits gradually emerged. El Salvador's electricity costs were much lower than other Bitcoin mining centers, and geothermal energy's stability ensured mining operations' continuity. The government planned to use mining revenues for infrastructure construction and social projects.

But this project also faced challenges. Initial investment was massive, technical requirements complex, and importing and maintaining mining equipment needed handling. Bitcoin price volatility also directly affected mining profitability.

## Spreading International Demonstration Effects

El Salvador's Bitcoin experiment produced obvious international demonstration effects. Though no other countries completely replicated this model, many countries began seriously considering digital currency policies.

The Central African Republic became the second country to make Bitcoin legal tender in 2022, though implementation scale was much smaller than El Salvador's. Parliaments in Panama, Paraguay, Brazil, and other Latin American countries all discussed similar bills.

More importantly, El Salvador's experiment changed international views on sovereign digital currencies. Previously considered impossible, this had now become a realistic policy discussion option.

Some international organizations began studying how to provide support and regulation for this new monetary policy type. Though the World Bank refused to directly support Bitcoin projects, it began researching Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) related policies.

## Long-term Strategic Significance and Historical Status

El Salvador's Bitcoin experiment carries historical significance transcending its borders. Regardless of final results, this experiment provided valuable practical experience for the world.

From monetary theory perspective, this was the first large-scale practice of Hayek's "denationalization of money" theory. A sovereign nation chose a non-domestically issued currency as legal tender—extremely rare in monetary history.

From technological development perspective, this was the first deep integration of blockchain technology with traditional national governance systems. El Salvador's practice provided reference for other countries exploring digital currency policies.

From geopolitical perspective, this represented small nations' efforts to seek independent development paths in the globalization era. Gaining international voice through technological innovation provided new ideas for other developing countries.

From financial innovation perspective, El Salvador created multiple precedents: sovereign Bitcoin bonds, geothermal mining, nationwide digital wallets—all carrying pioneering significance.

## Pioneer Courage and Future Insights

In 2023, when the whole world was observing El Salvador's Bitcoin experiment progress, Bukele reflected on this decision in an interview:

"We knew this was a huge risk, but we also knew it was a huge opportunity. El Salvador chose to bravely face the future rather than passively wait for change."

Indeed, El Salvador's experiment was full of uncertainty. Bitcoin's severe price volatility, international pressure, technical implementation complexity—these challenges were all real. But like all historical pioneers, El Salvador's risks might bring corresponding rewards.

If Bitcoin ultimately becomes a global reserve asset, El Salvador will be among the first countries to gain this advantage. If digital currency becomes the core of future financial systems, El Salvador has already gained valuable practical experience.

More importantly, El Salvador proved small countries can play important roles in global historical processes. Through brave innovation and determined execution, a Central American nation with only 6.4 million people became the world's focus.

In San Salvador's government office building, a Bitcoin commemorative coin sits on Bukele's desk. This gold coin bears the inscription "In cryptography we trust"—his hope for El Salvador's future.

Outside the window, volcanoes still burn silently, like El Salvador's Bitcoin experiment—quiet but full of energy, inconspicuous but potentially history-changing. Regardless of where this experiment ultimately leads, it has already written an indelible page in human monetary history.

History will remember September 7, 2021, remember this brave small nation, remember the first country to make Bitcoin legal tender. El Salvador is not only a participant in Bitcoin history but a creator. They used practice to answer a theoretical question: Can Bitcoin become true money?

The answer is still being written, but El Salvador has already begun this writing process.
