<p><em>"If you don't believe me or don't get it, I don't have time to try to convince you, sorry."</em><br></br>‚Äî‚ÄîSatoshi Nakamoto, July 29, 2010, last words on BitcoinTalk forum</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-genesis-moment">The Genesis Moment</h2>
<p>In London, January 2009, the cold winds of financial crisis still howled through the streets. At the newsstands, <em>The Times</em> front page glared with the headline: <strong>"Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks"</strong>.</p>
<p>For most people, this was just another annoying economic news story. But for a mysterious figure hidden in the cyber world, this was the moment he had been waiting for.</p>
<p>At exactly 18:15:05 GMT that day, on a computer somewhere in the world, keys softly clicked. There were no flowers, no applause, not even witnesses, but the entire digital world was born in that instant.</p>
<p>If God created the physical world in seven days, then Satoshi Nakamoto ignited the first light of the digital world in a single moment. What was created in that instant was humanity's first Bitcoin block‚Äîthe genesis block, Block #0. It had no predecessor, no parent, like the first light in Genesis, born from absolute nothingness.</p>
<p>This special block carried a string of seemingly cold numbers, but every character recorded history's turning point:</p>
<pre><code>Block Hash: 000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f
Previous Hash: 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
Timestamp: 2009-01-03 18:15:05 UTC
Nonce: 2083236893
Transactions: 1
Block Reward: 50 BTC
Difficulty: 1.00000000
</code></pre><p>The all-zero previous hash declared this was truly the "first"; the timestamp permanently recorded this historic moment; and that lucky random number 2083236893 was the answer Satoshi's computer found after trying over 2 billion attempts.</p>
<p>In this sacred moment, Bitcoin‚Äîthis digital life that would change the world‚Äîwas born.</p>
<p>The 50 bitcoins born in the genesis block, like the first gold of the digital world, quietly rested in the genesis address 1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa. Fifteen years have passed, and they remain untouched, like an eternal flame on an altar, guarding the origin of this new universe.</p>
<p>More wonderfully, these 50 bitcoins actually cannot be spent. Due to code design peculiarities, the genesis block's coinbase transaction wasn't properly added to the UTXO database, permanently "sacrificed" to the Bitcoin network. This might have been Satoshi's intentional design, or perhaps an oversight. But this "bug" created a beautiful metaphor: the creator sacrificed his first wealth in exchange for the birth of an entire digital world.</p>
<h2 id="the-message">The Message</h2>
<p>But this genesis block carried an even deeper mission. Satoshi inscribed a sentence in its coinbase data, like an inscription written on the digital world's foundation stone:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was exactly that day's <em>Times</em> front page headline. Why write this sentence?</p>
<p>To understand this inscription's deep meaning, we must return to that turbulent 2008. The global financial crisis swept the world like a tsunami, finally revealing Wall Street's greedy game in all its ugly glory. Lehman Brothers' collapse shocked the world with $158 billion in debt, AIG was taken over by the government, the US passed a $700 billion bank bailout bill. Round after round of bailout plans were announced, and the UK was considering a second bank bailout.</p>
<p>In this crisis, the most absurd plot repeatedly played out: the real estate bubble burst, millions of families lost their homes, while the bankers who caused the crisis remained safe under government protection, even continuing to receive astronomical bonuses. Where did the money to save banks come from? Of course, taxpayers' wallets. Governments fired up printing presses to madly print money while telling people this was to "save the economy."</p>
<p>This was traditional financial system logic: privatize profits, socialize losses.</p>
<p>Perhaps Satoshi wanted to say: it's time to create something different‚Äîsomething no one can control, with fixed supply, issued according to mathematical rules.</p>
<p>This inscription wasn't just witness to that era, but a declaration for the future. It forever sealed this historical moment in the blockchain, becoming a genesis oath that all who came after could see. Whenever someone questions Bitcoin's existence significance, this sentence is the most powerful answer.</p>
<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>The genesis block's birth was just the first step; the real test was whether this idea could work.</p>
<p>Five days later, Satoshi sent a seemingly plain email to the Cypherpunk mailing list: "Bitcoin v0.1 is now available." This email marked Bitcoin's crucial step from theory to practice.</p>
<p>The system Satoshi described was simple: a completely decentralized electronic cash system with no servers or central authority. Total issuance limited to 21 million coins, with 10.5 million issued in the first four years, then halved, halved again, and so on. Unlike government fiat that could be printed at will, Bitcoin's issuance was forever coded into its program.</p>
<p>Most ingenious was the mining mechanism: countless computers worked day and night performing a special calculation‚Äîfinding random numbers meeting specific conditions. This game's rules were interesting: verifying answers was super simple, anyone could confirm right or wrong in seconds; but finding answers was incredibly difficult, requiring billions of attempts to possibly succeed.</p>
<p>When a computer luckily found the correct answer, it immediately broadcast to the entire network: "I found it!" After all other nodes verified it was correct, the new block was added to the chain's end, and that computer received 50 bitcoins as reward. Then a new round of competition immediately began.</p>
<p>The system also automatically adjusted difficulty: too many miners would increase difficulty, too few would decrease it, always maintaining an average of one block every 10 minutes. No police, no regulation, relying only on code and clever incentive design, letting thousands of mutually distrustful strangers maintain the same ledger.</p>
<h2 id="revolution">Revolution</h2>
<p>At this moment, Satoshi completed generations' dreams: Hayek's 1976 prophecy of decentralized currency finally had real form; the pitfalls David Chaum encountered in the 1980s-1990s, Satoshi cleverly avoided; the technical fragments accumulated by Cypherpunks over 30+ years were perfectly assembled into a complete picture; the anger sparked by the 2008 financial crisis found constructive outlet.</p>
<p>When we look back to that moment on January 3, 2009, we find this wasn't just Bitcoin's genesis, but the digital world's fundamental turning point. Before this, the digital world had a fundamental problem: everything could be infinitely copied. A song could be copied countless times, an image could spread across the internet, making copies cost almost nothing. But the problem was, money is also information‚Äîif money could be freely copied, chaos would ensue.</p>
<p>With the genesis block, Satoshi introduced scarcity to the digital world: this was like digital gold, with only 21 million total, and "mining" required real electricity costs; no person or institution could control it alone; it operated entirely according to code rules, borderless, running 365 days a year without stopping. From then on, value could flow through networks like information, requiring no permission from intermediary institutions.</p>
<p>The deeper significance was that Bitcoin demonstrated a new organizational method: decentralized collaboration. Traditional companies need CEOs commanding, board decisions, headquarters buildings, hierarchical systems. Bitcoin? No CEO, no board, no employees‚Äîjust code running, with people worldwide participating according to consensus rules, yet creating a more stable system than many large corporations.</p>
<p>This "anarchic but orderly" state proved humanity could achieve large-scale collaboration without central authority. The Bitcoin network has run for 15 years without downtime, processed hundreds of millions of transactions, managed trillions of dollars in value‚Äîall without traditional "managers."</p>
<h2 id="rebuilding-the-tower-of-babel">Rebuilding the Tower of Babel</h2>
<p>Remember the Tower of Babel story from Chapter 1? God made humans speak different languages, unable to communicate and collaborate. For millennia, we've wanted to reunite: translation software can't solve cultural gaps, global trade can't stop political interference, the internet connects information but not value.</p>
<p>But Bitcoin is different. It uses mathematical language to transcend cultural differences, uses code logic to eliminate trust chasms. Americans can use it, Chinese can use it; all are equal before code, mathematical laws are universal.</p>
<p>Bitcoin's true genius isn't in how complex its technology is, but in its deep understanding of human nature: everyone wants to make money, so let honest people earn the most; everyone hates being cheated, so make the system not depend on trusting anyone. More ingeniously, it doesn't depend on any single individual‚ÄîSatoshi could choose to retire, but Bitcoin would continue growing.</p>
<p>In that instant, one era ended and another began. Hayek's prophecy found technical implementation, Cypherpunk dreams became running code, financial crisis anger transformed into constructive force.</p>
<p><strong>Genesis is complete, the legend has just begun.</strong></p>
<hr></hr>
<p><em>The genesis block has a strange property: its timestamp shows January 3, 2009, 18:15:05 UTC, but it was actually broadcast to the network on January 8th. This 6-day gap remains a mystery‚Äîwhat did Satoshi do during those 6 days? Was he perfecting code or waiting for the right moment? This puzzle adds more mystery to Bitcoin's birth. One theory suggests Satoshi was waiting for that Times headline to appear, to use it as timestamp proof for the genesis block.</em></p>
