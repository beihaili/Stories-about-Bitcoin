At 4 PM on January 10, 2024, a historic decision was taking place inside the SEC headquarters building in Washington, D.C. After more than a decade of repeated applications, rejections, appeals, and re-applications, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission finally agreed to approve Bitcoin spot ETFs.

At BlackRock headquarters in New York, CEO Larry Fink had just received the news. A few years ago, he called Bitcoin a "money laundering index," but now he was about to become one of the most important institutional promoters in Bitcoin's history. His iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) would become the flagship product among the 11 simultaneously approved Bitcoin ETFs.

"This is not just the launch of a new product," Fink told his team in an internal meeting, "this is a watershed moment in financial history. We are witnessing the process of a new asset class truly becoming mainstream."

That evening, trading systems at both NASDAQ and NYSE were conducting final tests, preparing to welcome the historic opening the next day. No one could predict how many records the upcoming trading volume would break, but everyone knew this would be the most important day in Bitcoin's history.

## The Difficult Journey of a Decade-Long Application Process

The history of Bitcoin ETF applications can be traced back to 2013. At that time, the Winklevoss brothers first submitted a Bitcoin ETF application to the SEC but were rejected. Since then, various institutions have successively submitted dozens of applications, all ending in failure.

The SEC's concerns mainly focused on several areas: market manipulation, custody security, insufficient liquidity, and incomplete regulatory frameworks. These concerns were indeed reasonable in the early days. The Bitcoin market was small, highly volatile, and regulations were unclear, presenting many risks.

But over time, these problems were gradually resolved. The Bitcoin market expanded to a trillion-dollar level, institutional investors entered in large numbers, custody services matured, and regulatory frameworks gradually became clearer. By 2023, the reasons for rejecting Bitcoin ETFs had become increasingly difficult to maintain.

The turning point came in August 2023. A asset management company called Grayscale, after losing its application to convert its Bitcoin trust into an ETF, appealed to the federal appeals court. Shockingly, the court supported Grayscale's view, believing the SEC's reasons for rejection were insufficient.

"The SEC needs to explain why the differential treatment of approving Bitcoin futures ETFs but rejecting spot ETFs is reasonable," the judge wrote in the ruling. This decision opened the door for all Bitcoin ETF applications.

Facing court pressure and growing political support, the SEC finally made its historic decision in January 2024.

## BlackRock's Strategic Transformation

Among all institutions applying for Bitcoin ETFs, BlackRock's participation was most symbolic. As the world's largest asset management company, managing over $10 trillion in assets, BlackRock's attitude change represented the entire Wall Street's shift in perception.

Larry Fink's personal transformation journey was particularly noteworthy. In 2017, he publicly called Bitcoin a "money laundering index," expressing extreme skepticism. But by 2023, he began calling Bitcoin "digital gold," believing it had long-term value storage functions.

This transformation didn't happen overnight. BlackRock's internal research team spent years deeply studying Bitcoin, analyzing its technical characteristics, market performance, and risk profile. They concluded that Bitcoin had become a mature alternative investment asset worthy of inclusion in institutional portfolios.

"My job is to create value for clients, not make decisions based on personal bias," Fink said when explaining his shift in view. "When data and analysis support Bitcoin's investment value, I must change my perspective."

BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust designed an extremely competitive fee structure: management fees of only 0.25%, far below many traditional ETFs. More importantly, BlackRock utilized its vast distribution network, allowing tens of millions of investors worldwide to access Bitcoin investment through familiar channels.

## Fierce Competition Among Wall Street Giants

The approval of Bitcoin ETFs triggered one of the most intense product competitions in Wall Street history. 11 companies received approval simultaneously, including well-known institutions like BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, VanEck, Invesco, and ARK Invest.

Each company tried to gain the maximum share in this historic opportunity. Fee competition was exceptionally fierce: most companies reduced management fees to 0.2-0.3%, with some even launching temporary free policies to attract early investors.

Fidelity's Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund became a strong competitor with its deep roots in traditional finance. As one of the largest 401(k) plan providers in the U.S., Fidelity could offer Bitcoin investment options to tens of millions of retirement savings accounts.

Grayscale's situation was most unique. They had been operating the Bitcoin Trust for years, accumulating a large investor base. ETF conversion meant they could eliminate the long-troubling premium/discount problem, but also faced pressure to significantly reduce management fees from 2%.

Traditional ETF experts like VanEck and Invesco relied on their experience in product design and marketing. ARK Invest's Cathie Wood attracted significant attention with her reputation in innovative investing.

The beneficiaries of this fierce competition were investors. Low fees, diversified choices, and high-quality service gave investors unprecedented convenience in Bitcoin investment.

## Market Celebration on First Trading Day

On January 11, 2024, the first trading day of Bitcoin spot ETFs created multiple historical records. The total trading volume of the 11 ETFs reached $4.69 billion, becoming the highest first-day trading volume product category in ETF history.

BlackRock's IBIT performed most impressively, with first-day trading volume reaching $1.05 billion. Fidelity's FBTC closely followed with trading volume of $670 million. Even the weakest performing ETF achieved tens of millions in first-day trading volume.

This massive demand immediately drove Bitcoin price increases. Bitcoin quickly rose from around $42,000 before ETF approval to $48,000, an increase of over 14%. The total market cap of the entire digital asset market increased by over $200 billion.

But what was truly impressive wasn't the price increase, but the sustainability of fund inflows. In the following weeks, Bitcoin ETFs continued to attract fund inflows, showing strong demand from institutional investors for this new investment tool.

"What we're seeing is not speculative short-term funds, but long-term allocation demand," analyzed an institutional sales director at Coinbase. "These are allocation funds from pension funds, insurance companies, and sovereign wealth funds."

## Historic Embrace by Traditional Investment Advisors

One of the most important impacts of Bitcoin ETF approval was enabling traditional investment advisors to provide Bitcoin investment advice to clients. Before ETFs launched, most financial advisors couldn't recommend Bitcoin investment due to compliance and technical reasons.

Morgan Stanley became one of the first Wall Street giants to provide Bitcoin ETF investment services to wealth management clients. They established detailed client suitability standards, recommending clients allocate 2.5% of their portfolios to Bitcoin ETFs.

Other large wealth management institutions like UBS, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America quickly followed. Although their recommended ratios were relatively conservative (usually between 1-5%), considering the massive asset scales these institutions manage, even small percentage allocations meant hundreds of billions in potential demand.

The independent investment advisor (RIA) community reacted more positively. Since they're usually more flexible and not constrained by large institutional conservative cultures, many RIAs began recommending higher Bitcoin allocation ratios.

"Our clients, especially younger clients, have been asking about Bitcoin investment," said an independent investment advisor managing $500 million in assets. "Now we can finally satisfy this demand in a way they're familiar with."

## Bitcoin Allocation in 401(k) and Retirement Accounts

Another important impact of Bitcoin ETF approval was enabling 401(k) and other retirement accounts to invest in Bitcoin. U.S. 401(k) plan total assets exceed $7 trillion, so if 1% were allocated to Bitcoin, it would mean $70 billion in demand.

Fidelity, as the largest 401(k) plan provider, led by announcing it would allow plan participants to invest up to 20% of their funds in Bitcoin ETFs. While this decision faced some regulatory agency questioning, other providers also began considering similar options.

Bitcoin allocation in retirement accounts has special significance. These funds typically have decades-long investment horizons, very suitable for Bitcoin as a long-term value storage asset. More importantly, this allocation transforms Bitcoin investment from speculative behavior to a component of retirement planning.

"When Bitcoin enters 401(k) plans, it's no longer a speculative asset but part of retirement savings," analyzed renowned investment advisor Ric Edelman. "The significance of this cognitive shift cannot be overstated."

But this development also sparked controversy. Some regulatory officials worried that highly volatile Bitcoin might not be suitable for retirement savings. The Department of Labor issued guidance requiring plan sponsors to carefully consider the appropriateness of Bitcoin investment.

## Market Significance of Grayscale Premium Disappearance

Bitcoin ETF approval had profound impacts on Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). GBTC had been the main channel for institutional investors to access Bitcoin, but its trust structure led to long-term premium/discount problems.

Before ETF approval, GBTC often traded at a 20-40% discount relative to the value of its held Bitcoin. This discount reflected the limitations of the trust structure: investors could buy but not redeem, only trade on secondary markets.

After ETF conversion, GBTC's discount quickly narrowed and approached zero. This was because ETF structure allows institutional investors to conduct arbitrage trading: when ETF prices deviate from net asset value, authorized participants can create or redeem ETF shares to eliminate the price difference.

This change improved Bitcoin's price discovery efficiency. Previously, GBTC's premiums and discounts were often misread as market sentiment indicators for Bitcoin. Now, Bitcoin prices more directly reflect supply and demand balance.

"ETF structure eliminates price distortions, allowing Bitcoin prices to more accurately reflect market fundamentals," said the research director at Galaxy Digital.

## Global ETF Product Chain Reaction

The successful approval of U.S. Bitcoin ETFs created a global chain reaction. Regulatory agencies in other countries and regions began re-evaluating their own Bitcoin ETF policies.

Canada had approved Bitcoin ETFs as early as 2021, with Purpose Bitcoin ETF becoming the world's first Bitcoin ETF. After U.S. ETF approval, Canadian products faced more intense competition but also benefited from increased overall market attention.

The European situation was more complex. While the EU hasn't approved traditional Bitcoin ETFs, Exchange Traded Products (ETPs) trade on some European exchanges. Bitcoin ETPs from companies like 21Shares, WisdomTree, and VanEck received good responses in markets like Germany and Switzerland.

Asian markets also became active. Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission stated it was studying Bitcoin ETF feasibility, and Japan's Financial Services Agency was also considering relevant policy adjustments. Regulatory agencies in markets like Singapore and Australia were closely watching U.S. developments.

"U.S. ETF approval has global demonstration effects," said a European asset management company executive. "If the U.S. considers Bitcoin ETFs safe, it's difficult for other countries to continue maintaining bans."

## New Models of Institutional Fund Inflows

Bitcoin ETFs changed the model of institutional fund inflows into Bitcoin markets. Previously, institutional investors mainly invested in Bitcoin through direct purchases, Grayscale trusts, or private funds. Now, they can invest through familiar ETF structures.

This change has profound impacts. ETF investment doesn't require institutional investors to learn private key management, custody arrangements, and other technical details, greatly lowering investment barriers. More importantly, ETFs comply with familiar operational processes and compliance requirements for institutional investors.

Large institutions like pension funds, insurance companies, and sovereign wealth funds began seriously considering Bitcoin allocation. Although allocation ratios are usually small (1-3%), considering these institutions' massive asset scales, even small percentage allocations mean hundreds of billions in potential demand.

"ETFs eliminated the last barriers for institutional investors," analyzed the CEO of Bitwise Asset Management. "Now Bitcoin investment has become as simple as investing in gold ETFs."

## Fundamental Changes in Market Structure

The launch of Bitcoin ETFs fundamentally changed Bitcoin market structure. ETFs became important bridges connecting traditional financial markets and Bitcoin markets, also changing price discovery mechanisms.

ETF creation and redemption mechanisms provided new liquidity sources for Bitcoin markets. When ETF demand exceeds supply, authorized participants purchase Bitcoin and create new ETF shares; when supply exceeds demand, they redeem ETF shares and sell Bitcoin.

This mechanism keeps Bitcoin prices consistent with ETF prices, and also allows traditional stock market trading volume to indirectly affect Bitcoin spot demand. To some extent, Bitcoin began exhibiting characteristics more like traditional financial assets.

At the same time, ETFs also changed Bitcoin's holding structure. ETF investors typically adopt long-term holding strategies, reducing market short-term volatility but also decreasing circulating supply.

## Historic Shift in Regulatory Attitudes

SEC approval of Bitcoin ETFs marked a historic shift in U.S. regulatory attitudes. From initial complete resistance, to cautious observation, to final approval, this process reflected regulatory agencies' gradual deepening understanding of digital assets.

SEC Chairman Gary Gensler emphasized in the approval statement that this doesn't mean the SEC endorses Bitcoin itself, but believes ETF structure can provide sufficient investor protection. But regardless of wording, approval itself confirms Bitcoin's legitimate status.

This regulatory attitude shift had global impact. As the global financial center, U.S. regulatory decisions are often referenced by other countries. U.S. ETF approval provided important precedent for global regulatory agencies.

"U.S. ETF approval is a watershed in digital asset regulatory history," commented former CFTC Chairman Chris Giancarlo. "It marks the basic completion of digital assets' transition from periphery to center."

## Improved Price Discovery Efficiency

ETF launch significantly improved Bitcoin price discovery efficiency. Previously, Bitcoin mainly traded on digital currency exchanges, whose user groups were relatively homogeneous. ETFs brought Bitcoin trading into traditional stock markets, attracting more diverse investor groups.

This diversification improved price discovery processes. Different types of investors make trading decisions based on different information and analytical models, allowing Bitcoin prices to more comprehensively reflect market information.

At the same time, ETFs also provided new arbitrage opportunities. Professional traders can arbitrage between ETF prices and spot prices, further enhancing price consistency.

"ETFs made Bitcoin price discovery more efficient," analyzed a New York University finance professor. "This is beneficial for the entire Bitcoin ecosystem."

## The Final Piece of the Institutionalization Process

Bitcoin ETF approval was widely seen as the final piece of Bitcoin's institutionalization process. Before this, Bitcoin had already gained support from traditional financial services like institutional custody, compliant trading, and professional auditing. ETF launch completed this institutionalization process.

This institutionalization has irreversible characteristics. Once Bitcoin is fully integrated into traditional financial systems, it's difficult to marginalize. Even facing regulatory pressure or political opposition, established financial infrastructure and investor interests form strong protective networks.

"ETF approval marks Bitcoin's transformation from experimental asset to institutional asset," analyzed a Harvard Business School professor. "This transformation is historic and irreversible."

In Wall Street's skyscrapers, traders are adapting to this new reality. Bitcoin is no longer an exotic digital currency but a standard allocation in investment portfolios. In investor conference rooms worldwide, Bitcoin allocation has become a daily discussion topic.

When Larry Fink spoke about Bitcoin at BlackRock's annual investor conference, his tone was full of confidence. The Wall Street veteran who criticized Bitcoin years ago had become an active promoter of digital assets.

"We are witnessing the birth of a new asset class," Fink told the investors below. "This is not just an investment opportunity, this is part of financial history."

The audience included pension fund managers, insurance company executives, and sovereign wealth fund investment directors. They came here not to hear speculative advice, but to understand how to allocate this emerging asset within strict risk control frameworks.

This scene would have been unimaginable a few years ago. Bitcoin transformed from a marginal asset to a mainstream investment choice, from a speculative tool to an institutionalized product. The speed and depth of this transformation exceeded everyone's expectations.

But historical progress often happens this way. Those who believed and persisted from the beginning are now enjoying history's rewards. And those institutions that once doubted and watched are now forced to acknowledge this new reality's existence.

The Bitcoin ETF story continues. With more institutional fund inflows, with further clarification of global regulatory environments, Bitcoin is transitioning from an investment choice to a necessity. Future finance textbooks will record January 10, 2024, as an important date in financial history—the day Bitcoin truly became mainstream.
