In the spring of 2013, as long queues formed outside banks in Cyprus, a group of young programmers in Beijing's Zhongguancun, eight thousand kilometers away from the Mediterranean, were excited about a seemingly incredible phenomenon. Trading data from BTCChina showed that China had become the world's largest Bitcoin trading market, accounting for over 90% of global trading volume.

This was a bewildering reversal. Just two years earlier, Chinese internet users were still struggling with how to bypass the Great Firewall to access overseas websites, and now they had suddenly become leaders in a global financial innovation.

## Chinese Aunties' New Battlefield

The story begins at a gold recycling shop on Beijing's East Third Ring Road. In April 2013, when international gold prices plummeted, the middle-aged female group dubbed "Chinese Aunties" by the media flooded the gold market, purchasing 300 tons of gold in just ten days, shocking the international gold market.

But soon, these sharp investors discovered a more interesting investment target. "Xiao Wang, have you heard of Bitcoin?" In a residential community in Chaoyang District, retired teacher Aunt Li asked the young man who runs an online store downstairs. "I saw on TV that this thing is rising faster than gold."

The TV program Aunt Li mentioned was CCTV-2's "Economic Information Network." In the first half of 2013, this authoritative financial program reported on Bitcoin multiple times, with a relatively neutral or even slightly positive tone. The host explained in the program: "Bitcoin is a virtual currency based on the internet, with characteristics of decentralization and anonymity, and its recent price increases have been astonishing."

This mainstream media attention created a chain reaction. From Beijing's hutongs to Guangzhou's urban villages, from Shenyang's state-owned enterprise dormitories to Hangzhou's small commodity markets, Bitcoin stories began to spread through China's streets and alleys. The age range of investors was surprisingly wide: from recent college graduates using their New Year's money to buy Bitcoin, to 50-year-old aunties using their retirement funds to trade.

BTCChina founder Yang Linke recalled those times: "Hundreds of new users registered every day, and customer service calls couldn't be answered. We often received inquiries like: 'I heard from my neighbor, what exactly is this Bitcoin? How do I buy it?'"

## The Golden Age of Exchanges

The explosive growth of Bitcoin trading in China brought unprecedented development opportunities for domestic exchanges. In addition to the established BTCChina, emerging exchanges like OKCoin and Huobi also rose rapidly during this period.

Huobi founder Li Lin was once an Oracle engineer who keenly smelled the business opportunity. "Chinese users have high requirements for trading experience," Li Lin said in an interview. "We launched 7×24 customer service, real-time market push, mobile apps, and other services that were innovative at the time."

More importantly, Chinese exchanges generally adopted a zero-fee model. This business model seemed inconceivable to overseas exchanges, but it was hugely successful in China. Zero fees reduced trading costs, attracted a large number of short-term speculators, and further pushed up trading volume.

OKCoin founder Xu Mingxing launched leveraged trading. "We found that Chinese users have a strong demand for high-risk, high-return products," Xu Mingxing explained. "Leveraged trading meets this demand and also brings us considerable revenue."

These innovations made Chinese Bitcoin exchanges lead the world in user experience. Overseas exchanges like Mt.Gox, though with longer histories, had already been left behind by their Chinese counterparts in terms of product features and service quality.

## Media Fanning the Flames

The rise of China's Bitcoin fever was inseparable from media promotion. In addition to CCTV's positive coverage, major financial media, portal websites, and even entertainment programs began to pay attention to Bitcoin.

Sina Technology's in-depth report titled "Bitcoin: Gold of the Internet Age" received hundreds of thousands of clicks. The article detailed Bitcoin's technical principles and investment value, explaining this complex technical concept in accessible language.

More influential were the statements of opinion leaders. Famous financial commentator Ye Tan wrote on Weibo: "Bitcoin represents monetary innovation in the internet age. Although the risk is high, it's worth considering as a small part of an asset portfolio." This Weibo post was reposted tens of thousands of times.

Even some entertainment celebrities began to pay attention to Bitcoin. Actor Huang Xiaoming posted a screenshot of his Bitcoin purchase on Weibo, with the caption: "Trying out a new era investment method." This Weibo post attracted a large number of fans to watch and discuss.

This comprehensive media attention created a strong speculative atmosphere. Bitcoin was no longer a niche hobby of tech geeks, but a hot topic of national concern.

## Regulators' Initial Concerns

However, Bitcoin's rapid development also attracted the attention of regulators. As early as the first half of 2013, the central bank began internal discussions about digital currency regulation.

An expert from the central bank's Monetary Policy Committee expressed concerns at an internal meeting: "Bitcoin's rapid development may affect the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. If large amounts of funds flow into this market, it may affect the circulation and stability of the renminbi."

What worried regulators even more was the risk of capital flight. Due to Bitcoin's natural cross-border nature, some people began using Bitcoin as a tool for capital outflow. Although the scale was not large, this trend attracted the attention of foreign exchange management departments.

But in the first half of 2013, these concerns had not yet translated into specific policy actions. Regulators adopted an attitude of observation and research, trying to better understand the characteristics and risks of this emerging market.

## December 5: Policy Emergency Brake

On December 5, 2013, Beijing's first snow had just melted, but China's Bitcoin market was hit by a severe cold. That afternoon, the People's Bank of China and four other ministries jointly issued the "Notice on Preventing Bitcoin Risks," marking a major shift in the Chinese government's Bitcoin policy.

The core content of the notice can be summarized in several points: Bitcoin does not have legal status equivalent to currency and cannot and should not be used as currency in market circulation; financial institutions and payment institutions must not conduct Bitcoin-related business; but Bitcoin, as a specific virtual commodity, can be freely bought and sold by ordinary people at their own risk.

Although the wording of this notice was relatively mild, its impact on the market was enormous. Within minutes of the notice's release, Bitcoin prices began a cliff-like decline. From the opening price of $1,200 that day, the price fell to around $400 within 24 hours, a drop of over 60%.

BTCChina's servers were almost paralyzed within half an hour of the notice's release, with a large number of users simultaneously logging in trying to sell Bitcoin. Yang Linke recalled: "That was the darkest day I experienced since starting my business. Within a few hours, our trading volume reached ten times the usual amount, but it was all sell orders."

## Market Panic Reaction

The market panic triggered by the policy notice far exceeded expectations. In a Bitcoin café in Beijing's Zhongguancun, the originally bustling discussion area suddenly fell silent. People who had been excitedly discussing investment returns just hours ago now looked at each other, not knowing how to respond to this sudden policy change.

"I just bought 100 Bitcoins, what should I do now?" a young investor asked in a QQ group. "Sell them, who knows what the government will do next?" another investor replied.

Panic quickly spread. In a computer market in Shenzhen's Huaqiangbei, merchants who originally specialized in selling mining equipment began to sell off inventory at reduced prices. "Two days ago, people were still queuing to buy mining machines, now no one even asks for prices," a merchant said helplessly.

More serious was the chain reaction in the banking system. Although the notice only prohibited financial institutions from conducting Bitcoin-related business, many banks, out of caution, began to freeze accounts related to Bitcoin exchanges. This further exacerbated market panic.

## Exchanges' Difficult Response

Facing the policy shock, major Bitcoin exchanges had to urgently adjust their operational strategies. BTCChina was the first to issue an announcement, stating that it would strictly comply with the notice requirements and suspend RMB deposit services.

Huobi and OKCoin also quickly followed suit, issuing similar announcements. But these exchanges emphasized in their announcements that personal Bitcoin trading was still legal, and exchanges would continue to provide trading platform services for users.

"Our biggest challenge is how to maintain business operations while complying with regulations," Li Lin recalled. "We spent a lot of time studying the notice's provisions, trying to find business models allowed by the policy."

Some exchanges began exploring new payment channels. Since direct bank payments were prohibited, they began cooperating with third-party payment companies or adopting offline deposit methods. These workaround measures, while increasing operational complexity, to some extent alleviated the liquidity crisis.

## The Beginning of Overseas Migration

Facing the deterioration of the domestic policy environment, some Chinese Bitcoin companies began considering overseas expansion. Huobi began preparing for an overseas exchange in early 2014, and OKCoin also launched an internationalization strategy.

"The uncertainty of the policy environment forced us to diversify our development," Xu Mingxing said at a company internal meeting. "We can't put all our eggs in one basket."

This overseas migration included not only companies but also talent and capital. Some technical personnel working in the Bitcoin industry began considering going abroad for development, and some investors began transferring funds to overseas exchanges.

This trend intensified in the following years, eventually forming a large-scale outflow of Chinese Bitcoin talent and capital.

## Historical Reflection

China's sharp turn in Bitcoin policy had a profound impact on global digital currency development. The most direct impact was the shift in the global Bitcoin market center of gravity. Starting from the end of 2013, the United States and Europe gradually became the main markets for Bitcoin trading, and China's influence declined significantly.

More importantly, China's policy choices provided an important reference case for other countries. Some countries, seeing that China's strict regulation did not cause serious social problems, also adopted similar policies.

But China's policy choices also brought some unexpected consequences. Strict regulation, while controlling speculative risks, also suppressed technological innovation. In the following years, China began to lag behind the United States and Europe in blockchain technology development.

When the last snow of 2013 covered Beijing, China's Bitcoin fever was nearing its end. In those cafés in Zhongguancun, young programmers began discussing new technical directions. Some turned to mobile internet, some devoted themselves to artificial intelligence, and others chose to go abroad for development.

But the seeds of Bitcoin had been sown in this land. Although the cold wind of policy temporarily prevented its growth, the power of technology would eventually find new outlets. Like those seeds lying dormant in the harsh winter, they were waiting for the arrival of the next spring.

*The December 5 notice remains the foundational document of China's digital currency policy to this day, and that winter afternoon that changed the entire industry's development trajectory is forever recorded in Bitcoin's history.*
