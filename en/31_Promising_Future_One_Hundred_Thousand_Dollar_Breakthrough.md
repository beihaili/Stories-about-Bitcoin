At 3:08 AM GMT on December 5, 2024, a historic number appeared on the screens of tens of millions of Bitcoin holders worldwide: $103,679.

Bitcoin price broke through the $100,000 psychological barrier for the first time.

In New York's Times Square, on the giant billboard that displays Bitcoin prices 24/7, the six-digit price flashed in the neon sea. Passersby stopped to take photos with their phones. A taxi driver excitedly told his passenger: "The Bitcoin I bought in 2020 is now worth a house!"

In a coffee shop in San Francisco, several Silicon Valley programmers were celebrating. The Bitcoin they mined through programming ten years ago had now made them millionaires. "Remember when everyone said Bitcoin would go to zero in 2017?" one of them laughed. "Who dares call this a bubble now?"

At a Bitcoin community gathering in Beijing, despite China's strict stance on digital currency trading, people were still quietly discussing this historic moment. An early Bitcoin evangelist said excitedly: "From $0.00076 in 2009 to $103,679 today, this is the greatest wealth creation experiment in human history."

$100,000 is not just a number; it represents the end of one era and the beginning of another. Bitcoin has evolved from a cryptographic experiment to a globally recognized digital asset, from a marginal investment to a mainstream wealth management tool.

## Trump Victory's Policy Expectation Catalyst

On November 6, 2024, when Donald Trump was confirmed to have won the U.S. presidential election, Bitcoin price immediately began soaring. Daily gains exceeded $6,000, jumping directly from $68,000 to $74,000, setting a new all-time high at the time.

This reaction was not accidental. Trump expressed friendly attitudes toward digital assets during his campaign, promising to establish a "U.S. National Bitcoin Reserve" and hinting at firing SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, who held harsh attitudes toward digital assets.

"Trump's election changed the entire game," a Wall Street analyst commented. "From regulatory resistance to policy support, this transformation's impact is enormous."

More importantly, Trump's victory represented a fundamental shift in American political attitudes. A Republican-controlled Congress was more likely to pass legislation favorable to digital assets, and federal regulatory agencies' attitudes could become more friendly.

During the campaign, Trump's speech at the Bitcoin conference was seen as a turning point. "If I am elected, America will become the world's digital asset capital," he promised the audience. "We will not only embrace innovation but lead innovation."

This policy expectation created strong buying pressure. Institutional investors began large-scale Bitcoin allocation, fearing they would miss the policy dividend period. Retail investors also entered en masse, hoping to get better investment positions before new policies were implemented.

From election day to the $100,000 breakthrough in one month, Bitcoin price rose over 50%. This magnitude of increase is unimaginable in traditional assets but not uncommon in Bitcoin's history.

## Critical Scale of Institutional Allocation

Behind the price breakthrough, institutional investors' allocation scale had reached a historic critical point. In 2024, Bitcoin ETFs attracted over $31 billion in net inflows, not including institutional funds that directly purchased Bitcoin.

BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) became one of the fastest-growing ETFs in history, with assets under management breaking through $50 billion in just 11 months. Fidelity's Bitcoin ETF also achieved similar success, with over $20 billion under management.

"What we're seeing is not speculative buying but long-term allocation demand," analyzed Coinbase's institutional business director. "Pension funds, insurance companies, and sovereign wealth funds are all systematically allocating Bitcoin."

MicroStrategy continued its Bitcoin acquisition spree. Under Michael Saylor's leadership, the company had accumulated over 400,000 Bitcoin, worth over $40 billion. Saylor frequently shared his "digital asset strategy" philosophy on social media, influencing countless other corporate decisions.

Tesla, although selling part of its Bitcoin holdings in late 2021, Elon Musk's supportive attitude toward Bitcoin hadn't changed. When Bitcoin broke through $100,000, Musk posted a simple but meaningful emoji on Twitter: 🚀.

More traditional companies also began joining Bitcoin allocation teams. Software companies, real estate firms, and even some manufacturing companies announced Bitcoin investment plans. "Cash is losing value, Bitcoin is preserving and increasing value," a corporate CFO frankly explained this transformation.

## Fundamental Changes in Supply and Demand Structure

The fourth halving event on April 19, 2024, reduced daily new Bitcoin supply from 900 to 450. This supply shock's impact was fully manifested in the year-end price breakthrough.

"Halving effects usually take 12-18 months to fully manifest," analyzed a digital asset researcher. "The price breakthrough we're seeing now is the result of supply scarcity taking effect."

Meanwhile, the proportion of long-term holders (HODLers) continued increasing. On-chain data shows over 70% of Bitcoin hadn't moved for more than a year, indicating most holders adopted long-term holding strategies.

Institutional investors' "HODLing" behavior was even more obvious. Unlike retail investors, institutional investors typically make 3-5 year investment plans and don't change strategies due to short-term price volatility. This long-term holding behavior further reduced tradeable supply in the market.

Exchange Bitcoin balances were also continuously declining. Data shows major exchanges' Bitcoin inventories decreased by over 30% compared to 2020. This trend indicates investors increasingly tend to custody Bitcoin themselves rather than leaving it on exchanges for frequent trading.

"Decreased supply elasticity is the core factor driving price increases," noted a Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance report. "When most Bitcoin is held long-term, even relatively small demand growth can lead to significant price increases."

## Final Establishment of "Digital Gold" Narrative

The $100,000 breakthrough marked the final global establishment of the "digital gold" narrative. This wasn't just a price milestone but a qualitative change in social cognition.

Over the past few years, Bitcoin's correlation with gold had been increasing. When traditional investors considered inflation hedges or asset diversification, Bitcoin had become a choice alongside gold. Some portfolios even began partially replacing gold allocation with Bitcoin.

"Our clients now view Bitcoin as 'Gold 2.0'," said a Swiss private banker. "It has all of gold's advantages—scarcity, value storage function, anti-inflation characteristics—but also digital convenience."

Academic research on Bitcoin was also deepening. Multiple studies showed Bitcoin's role in long-term portfolios was similar to gold, but with higher volatility and potentially greater returns. Modern portfolio theory began analyzing Bitcoin as an independent asset class.

Central bank and government attitudes were also shifting. Although most central banks remained cautious, some had begun studying the possibility of including Bitcoin in foreign exchange reserves. El Salvador's experiment provided reference cases for other countries.

"Bitcoin has evolved from a speculative asset to a reserve asset," analyzed an economist. "The $100,000 breakthrough confirms the completion of this transformation."

## Profound Impact on Global Financial Landscape

Bitcoin's breakthrough of $100,000 had profound impacts on the global financial landscape. The most direct was the potential impact on the U.S. dollar's international reserve currency status.

Although Bitcoin's market cap (about $2 trillion) was still relatively small compared to global foreign exchange reserves (about $12 trillion), its growth speed and decentralized characteristics made some countries reconsider reserve asset structures.

"Bitcoin provides a reserve choice not affected by any single country's policies," an anonymous central bank official said. "In an era of rising geopolitical risks, this characteristic has special value."

Central bank research on digital currencies also accelerated. Development of digital yuan, digital euro, and digital dollar all accelerated, as countries hoped to maintain monetary sovereignty in the digital currency era.

Financial innovation was also accelerating. Bitcoin-based financial products became increasingly diversified: options, futures, structured products, lending services, etc. Traditional financial institutions were fully integrating Bitcoin into their product systems.

"We are witnessing a paradigm shift in monetary systems," said an MIT economist. "Bitcoin's $100,000 breakthrough is just a milestone in this transformation process."

## Accelerated Intergenerational Wealth Transfer

Bitcoin's price breakthrough of $100,000 accelerated the intergenerational wealth transfer process. Millennial and Gen Z investors, who began investing in Bitcoin early, were now enjoying massive returns.

A survey showed that among high-net-worth individuals under 35, over 40% of wealth came from digital asset investment. This proportion was unimaginable among traditional wealthy groups but common among the new rich.

"We're seeing the birth of a new wealth class," observed a wealth management expert. "Their wealth management philosophies are completely different from traditional wealthy people."

These "Bitcoin wealthy" individuals' wealth management methods were also changing the entire industry. They were more inclined toward digital investment tools, more concerned with ESG investing, and more actively participated in philanthropy. Some early Bitcoin investors had already pledged most of their wealth to charity.

Traditional family wealth management institutions were also adapting to this change. Swiss private banks began providing digital asset custody services, and U.S. family offices began hiring digital asset experts.

"Wealth digitization transformation is inevitable," said a family office director. "We must learn to serve these new wealthy clients."

## Historic Shift in Social Psychology

The $100,000 breakthrough represented a historic shift in social psychology. Bitcoin transformed from "might be a scam" to "missed opportunity," from "speculative bubble" to "necessary allocation."

Media reporting tones showed obvious changes. A few years ago, Bitcoin news often appeared in technology sections; now it was front-page news in financial sections. Analysts discussed not "whether Bitcoin has value" but "how high Bitcoin prices could go."

Public acceptance of Bitcoin was also rapidly increasing. Polls showed over 60% of American adults considered Bitcoin a "legitimate investment," a proportion that was less than 30% in 2020.

Corporate attitude changes were even more obvious. Among Fortune 500 companies, over 100 had some form of Bitcoin exposure—either as investment, payment method, or service content.

"Bitcoin has become business world common sense," wrote a Wall Street Journal editorial. "Business leaders refusing to understand Bitcoin now look like they're refusing to understand the internet."

## Critical Point Breakthrough in Technology Adoption

The price breakthrough of $100,000 also marked Bitcoin technology adoption reaching a critical point. Lightning Network usage grew 300% in 2024, with more merchants beginning to accept Bitcoin payments.

El Salvador's Bitcoin experiment continued advancing, with Chivo wallet active users steadily growing. Although not all Salvadorans actively used Bitcoin, adoption rates among young people noticeably improved.

Other countries were also observing and learning. Politicians in Central African Republic, Panama, Paraguay, and other countries all proposed similar Bitcoin bills. Although most hadn't passed, the discussions themselves indicated attitude shifts.

Payment sector innovation was also accelerating. PayPal, Visa, and MasterCard were all expanding their Bitcoin-related services. Apple Pay and Google Pay were also studying possibilities of integrating digital currencies.

"We are approaching a critical point in technology adoption," analyzed a payment industry expert. "When Bitcoin payments become as convenient as credit card payments, adoption speed will grow exponentially."

## Environmental Sustainability Improvements

Surprisingly, while Bitcoin price broke through $100,000, its mining environmental friendliness also continued improving. Sustainable Bitcoin Initiative (SBI) data showed Bitcoin mining's renewable energy usage proportion exceeded 50%.

This improvement had several reasons. First, renewable energy costs continued declining, making clean energy mining economically more attractive. Second, ESG investment philosophy popularization made miners more concerned about environmental impact. Finally, some countries and regions provided policy incentives for renewable energy use.

El Salvador's volcanic geothermal mining project became a sustainable mining benchmark. Using entirely geothermal energy, zero carbon emissions, good economic benefits. This project attracted worldwide attention and promoted similar projects in other countries.

"Bitcoin mining is becoming an important force driving renewable energy development," said an energy expert. "Miners' demand for cheap, stable electricity actually accelerates clean energy infrastructure construction."

Some environmental organizations also began changing their views on Bitcoin. Although controversy remained, more people recognized Bitcoin network energy use was transparent, measurable, and becoming more sustainable.

## Global Convergence of Regulatory Frameworks

While Bitcoin broke through $100,000, global regulatory frameworks were also gradually converging. Although specific policies in different countries still had differences, "regulate rather than prohibit" had become the mainstream trend.

The EU's MiCA regulation provided a comprehensive digital asset regulatory framework. Although the U.S. was still formulating federal-level laws, state legislative activities were very active. Asian countries like Japan, Singapore, and Hong Kong were all improving their respective regulatory systems.

This regulatory convergence created favorable environments for Bitcoin's global development. Cross-border investment became easier, compliance costs decreased, and market confidence strengthened.

"Improved regulatory clarity is an important factor driving institutional investment," analyzed a legal expert. "When rules are clear, institutional investors dare to invest boldly."

International organizations were also playing coordinating roles. Bank for International Settlements (BIS), Financial Stability Board (FSB), and International Monetary Fund (IMF) were all formulating international standards and best practices for digital assets.

## Realistic Response to Quantum Computing Threats

With Bitcoin's value increase, concerns about its security also increased. Quantum computing technology development was seen as a potential threat to Bitcoin's long-term security.

But Bitcoin developer communities were fully prepared. Post-quantum cryptography research had been ongoing for years. Once quantum computing threats became real, the Bitcoin network could implement quantum-resistant algorithms through soft fork upgrades.

"Bitcoin network security doesn't only depend on current encryption technology," explained a cryptography expert. "Its real advantage is the ability to upgrade with technological development."

IBM, Google, and other quantum computing leaders were also cooperating with Bitcoin developers, ensuring protective measures would be in place before quantum threats became real.

"This is a race against time," said a quantum computing researcher. "But we're confident protective measures can outrun threats."

## Philosophical-Level Historical Reflection

Bitcoin's breakthrough of $100,000 was not just a financial event but a philosophical-level historic event. It proved decentralized organizations could create enormous value, proved mathematics and code could build trust, proved individuals could possess true financial sovereignty.

Since Satoshi Nakamoto published the whitepaper in 2008, Bitcoin represented questioning and challenging traditional financial systems. The $100,000 breakthrough indicated this challenge had achieved success.

"Bitcoin's success is not just a technological victory but an ideological victory," commented renowned economist Saifedean Ammous. "It proves the power of individual sovereignty and free markets."

This philosophical significance transcended financial fields. Bitcoin's success provided examples for other decentralized projects, promoting entire Web3 and decentralized technology development.

But at the same time, Bitcoin's success also brought new thinking. When a decentralized system becomes so valuable, it inevitably attracts government and large institution attention and participation. Is this participation driving or threatening? Evolution or betrayal?

## Deep Meaning Behind Psychological Barriers

Although $100,000 was just a psychological barrier, its symbolic significance far exceeded the number itself. This six-digit price truly brought Bitcoin into the "major asset" category.

In traditional investment worlds, six-digit prices usually meant scarcity and value. Real estate, art, collectibles—assets worth six digits were often seen as wealth symbols. Now Bitcoin had joined this category.

"$100,000 gave Bitcoin psychological 'legitimacy'," analyzed a behavioral economist. "Numbers themselves change people's perceptions and behaviors."

More importantly, this price level truly gave Bitcoin reserve asset characteristics. When a single Bitcoin was worth $100,000, it could bear larger-scale value transfer and storage needs.

For early investors, this price breakthrough meant their beliefs received historic validation. Those who believed and held when Bitcoin prices were just a few dollars or even cents were now enjoying one of the largest wealth creations in human history.

## New Starting Point for Future Outlook

The $100,000 breakthrough was not an endpoint but a new starting point. Many analysts believed this was just a milestone in Bitcoin's long-term price discovery process.

PlanB's Stock-to-Flow model predicted Bitcoin prices could eventually reach millions of dollars. ARK Invest's Cathie Wood predicted Bitcoin could reach $1.5 million by 2030. These predictions, while seemingly radical, weren't impossible considering Bitcoin's historical performance.

"If Bitcoin truly becomes a global reserve asset, then $100,000 is just the beginning," analyzed an investment strategist. "1% of global liquidity is several trillion dollars, enough to drive Bitcoin prices to millions of dollars."

But more importantly, the $100,000 breakthrough created conditions for Bitcoin's functional evolution. When a single Bitcoin had such high value, it was more suitable as a large-value storage and transfer tool, similar to gold's role in international reserves.

At a Bitcoin meetup in Tokyo, a Japanese elder raised his glass in celebration. He had started mining Bitcoin in 2010, witnessing this digital asset grow from cents to six digits. "We witnessed history," he told young participants, "but history is just beginning."

In a London investment bank, traders were adjusting their Bitcoin models. The $100,000 breakthrough made all traditional valuation frameworks seem outdated. "We need to rethink what is value, what is money, what is asset," said a senior analyst.

Around the world, similar scenes were playing out. Bitcoin's $100,000 breakthrough not only changed investment portfolios but changed people's understanding of money, value, and wealth.

When Satoshi Nakamoto published the Bitcoin whitepaper in 2008, he might not have imagined this experiment would go so far. From "peer-to-peer electronic cash system" to "digital gold," from cryptographic experiment to global asset, Bitcoin's evolution exceeded everyone's expectations.

$100,000 is just one chapter in this story, but it's a crucial chapter. It marks Bitcoin's historic completion of the transition from margin to center, from experiment to reality, from ideal to mainstream.

Future historians might record December 5, 2024, as an important date in financial history—the day a new asset class truly became an important component of world wealth. The day a fifteen-year-old ideal from an anonymous programmer finally pierced reality.
